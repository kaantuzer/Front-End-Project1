          Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created
          by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A
          Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R.
          Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show premiered on
          HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19,
          2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons. Set on the
          fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a
          large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the
          course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of
          the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts
          among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting
          for independence from whoever sits on it. The second major arc focuses
          on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has
          been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne.
          The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the
          realm against threats from beyond the Seven Kingdoms' northern border.
          Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad,
          active, and international fan base. Many critics and publications have
          named the show one of the greatest television series of all time.
          Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters,
          story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of
          nudity and violence (including sexual violence) generated controversy.
          The final season received significant criticism for its reduced length
          and creative decisions, with many considering it a disappointing
          conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by
          a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018
          and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards
          for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations
          for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama. A
          prequel series, House of the Dragon, premiered on HBO in 2022. A
          second prequel currently in production, A Knight of the Seven
          Kingdoms, is scheduled to debut in 2025.
